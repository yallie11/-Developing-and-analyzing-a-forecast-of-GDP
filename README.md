The accuracy of time series forecasting in identifying South Africaâ€™s economic output trends is a valuable decision and policymaking tool for government, academicians, and investors. The following paper, which I achieved 90% for , was completed in fulfillment of my honours degree at UCT. The paper first applies the ACF and PACF to select the best ARIMA models based on the lowest AICc from maximum likelihood estimation and then proceeds to use the Ordinary least squares estimator for the ARDL models. The findings of the paper suggest that the ARIMA (2,2,3) selected for predicting the raw real GDP series underperforms the economic growth rate ARIMA (3,0,2) specification in both the multi-step and rolling one-step accuracy metrics. The ARDL (2,3,2), including significant consumption and government growth rate predictors, outperforms the other models of the same ARDL class based on the low MAE but comes second to the AR(4) as evaluated on RMSE. Overall, the multi-step ARIMA (3,0,2) is the best forecasting model for economic growth rate based on both the MAE and RMSE metric
